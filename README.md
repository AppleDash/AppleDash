Hey! I'm AppleDash, or Blackjack. I'm a professional software developer who started out as a hobbyist, now with 12+ years of experience under my belt. My main professional experience is with game development and adjacent work, but I'm quite versatile due to my extensive hobby and volunteer experience.

I enjoy desktop and server development in C, C++, Python, or Java; Web backend development in Ruby, PHP, or JS/TS; and Web frontend development with HTML5, CSS3, and JS or TS.

Outside of regular programming, I'm passionate about analogue and digital electronics, old computers, and reverse engineering.

Above all, I love building things that make people happy, and make a positive impact on their lives. I hope something here does that for you. ðŸ˜€

**I am currently seeking new opportunities** to apply my skills and experience to impactful projects in any sector. Whether it's collaborating as part of a team or taking the lead on a 
project, I'm excited to help build something extraordinary.

Feel free to reach out via e-mail to me \[at] blackjack \[dot] codes to request my resume or discuss how we can work together.
